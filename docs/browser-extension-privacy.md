# Vintrack Browser Sync Privacy Policy

Effective date: October 5, 2026

Vintrack Browser Sync links a Vinted account that the user is already signed in
to with the Vintrack service. The extension runs only on the public Vintrack
application and the explicitly supported Vinted regional domains.

## Data handled by the extension

When the user connects or refreshes a linked account, the extension sends these
values to the configured public Vintrack service:

- the Vinted `access_token_web` access token;
- the selected Vinted regional domain;
- the Vinted account ID and display name, used to prevent linking a different
  account by mistake; and
- the browser user-agent string, only when the Firefox user has granted the
  optional technical-data permission.

When the user opens the companion on a supported Vinted catalog or item page,
the extension sends that active page URL to Vintrack. Vintrack validates the
regional Vinted domain, removes tracking and sensitive parameters, and uses the
remaining item ID or catalog filters only to show existing Vintrack state and
prepare a form handoff. No monitor or Price Watch is created by inspecting a
page.

After authenticating the locally stored browser-link token, Vintrack may return
the linked-account status, six recent monitor finds, and the user's Price Watch
list for display in the popup or inline drawer. The inline companion is enabled
by default on supported Vinted pages and can be disabled in the popup. Pausing,
resuming, and deleting a Price Watch requires a deliberate click; deletion also
requires confirmation. Recent finds refresh every 12 seconds only while the
Feed tab is open.

The extension stores the Vintrack light or dark theme locally and mirrors that
preference between the approved Vintrack page and supported Vinted pages. It
also stores a random, revocable Vintrack browser-link token and local sync state
required to maintain the connection, plus the user's popup-only or inline
companion preference. Local maintenance state also includes the linked regional
domain and cookie-store ID, retry times, and a SHA-256 fingerprint of the last
successfully synced access token and browser-link token; token fingerprints are
not sent to Vintrack.

Session renewal uses an existing matching Vinted tab or background requests to
the supported Vinted origin. Browser-managed cookies accompany those requests;
the extension does not read the refresh token or transmit it to Vintrack. It
never opens or reloads tabs for automatic renewal. A login or security challenge
is left for the user to handle in Vinted.

The extension does **not** transmit the complete browser cookie jar, the Vinted
browser refresh token, the Vinted password, payment-card data, or browsing
history outside the supported Vintrack and Vinted pages.

The companion does not automate checkout, purchase confirmation, likes, offers,
or messages.

When the user clicks Open Checkout in Vintrack or opens a checkout notification
link in a visible browser tab, Vintrack automatically asks the
extension to prepare a checkout in the matching signed-in Vinted account.
The extension verifies the current Vinted account before creating a buy
transaction, building checkout, and requesting saved delivery/payment defaults.
Normal Oneclick opens Vinted for the user to review and confirm the purchase
and does not initiate payment. Users can separately enable PayPal auto-checkout
in supported regions after accepting a payment warning and setting a maximum
EUR order total. A buy-link click can then submit one Vinted payment request
and open the returned PayPal checkout. Missing or ambiguous prices, applied
wallet funds, unavailable PayPal or a total above the limit require manual
review. New monitor matches do not initiate purchases without a click.
The local
preparation checkpoint stores item, seller and account IDs, regional domain,
start time and a generated checkout link for up to ten minutes of reuse; it
prevents repeated starts after lost responses. Auto-checkout attempt records,
including the selected preferences and limit, remain locally until extension
state is cleared or the extension is removed. Vintrack retains a server-side
identity/item attempt marker without automatic expiry while its Redis data is
retained, preventing repeated automatic payment starts across browser changes,
relinking and cache expiry. Completed links are also kept
in a local history of up to twenty links. Clearing extension state removes
both histories. Account tokens and payment-card data are not part of these
checkout histories. PayPal redirect URLs can contain payment tokens; they are
used only for immediate navigation and are not stored in those histories or
Vintrack's preparation records. The immediate response is transmitted between
the matching Vinted tab, extension and Vintrack page to finish the handoff.

## Purpose, storage, and deletion

The data is used only to create and maintain the linked Vinted session, validate
that reconnects belong to the expected Vinted account, and support user-requested
Vintrack account actions. Linked-session data is stored by Vintrack using its
encrypted session persistence until the account is unlinked or the stored data
is deleted. Local extension state remains in the browser until the user clears
it, removes the extension, or connects it again.

Vintrack does not sell extension data. Data is shared only with the Vintrack
service selected by this public build and with Vinted when the user requests a
linked-account action.
